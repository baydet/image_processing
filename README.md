- text recongnition (alpha version :) )

Written in java.

Tasks provided by Ablameyko (chief of Belarusian State University) and Andrew (his funny and little dangerous son :) ).

If you are student of faculty of applied math and computer science at Belarusian State University this program may be useful for you :)

Enjoy your free time! ;)
