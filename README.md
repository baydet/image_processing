image_processing
================

Simple algorithms for image processing.
- converting to grayscale
- inverting
- building gistogramm
- binarisation (manual and auto-detecting brightness bound)
- segmentation (simply, round gistogramm n times, round gistogramm till n segments)
- detecting image contours (binary and gray contours)
- text recongnition (alpha version :) )

Written in java.

Tasks provided by Ablameyko (chief of Belarusian State University) and Andrew (his funny and little dangerous son :) ).

If you are student of faculty of applied math and computer science at Belarusian State University this program may be useful for you :)

Enjoy your free time! ;)
